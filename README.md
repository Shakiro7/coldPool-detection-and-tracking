## ðŸ§Š Overview

Cold pools are crucial mesoscale phenomena influencing convection and boundary layer dynamics. This repository provides an efficient, physically interpretable Python-based algorithm for detecting and tracking cold pools in large-eddy simulation (LES) output.

The code was developed in the context of the paper above and is structured to replicate all analysis and figures using the provided data.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shakiro7/coldPool-detection-and-tracking.git
cd coldPool-detection-and-tracking
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment *(optional but recommended)*

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download the Example Dataset

The dataset used in the publication is hosted on Zenodo:

ðŸ“¦ [Zenodo Dataset (10.5281/zenodo.10115957)](https://zenodo.org/records/10115957)

Download the simulation files (`*.nc`) and place them in a suitable data directory. Update the paths in the `main.py` accordingly.

### 5. Run the Algorithm

```bash
python main.py
```

The results, including plots and tracking outputs, can be saved in the specified output directory.

## ðŸ“Š Reproducing Paper Results

All analysis and figures from the paper can be reproduced using this code and the Zenodo dataset. For detailed instructions, refer to the comments and documentation within `main.py` as well as the paper.
